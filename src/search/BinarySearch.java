/*
 * Binary Search: This only works if array is sorted but is better than Linear Search.
 * 					Has O(logN) time complexity.
 * 
 * The binary search begins by comparing the target value to the value of the middle element
 * of the sorted array:
 * 
 * - If this element is greater than the target value, we continue search on left sub-array
 * 
 * - If element is less, we continue search on right sub-array
 * 
 * Why is it good? Because we can discard half the items on every iteration so logarithmic time
 * complexity.
