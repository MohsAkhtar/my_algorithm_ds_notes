/*
 * Interpolation Search: Also works only on sorted array. It is similar to when we look for a name
 * 						in a telephone book.
 * 
 * - We make a guess in the remaining search space the sought item might be
 * - In Binary Search we jump straight to middle element - Here is not the case!!!
 * ~ We just make a simple linear interpolation
 * 
 * For example if we are looking for names:-
 * 
 * 	a a a a a z z z
 * 
 * There will be more names with 'a' than 'z' so it does not make sense to go straight to middle.
 * 
 * Has a O(log logN) time complexity.
